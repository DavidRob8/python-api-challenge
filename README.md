The Python API Challenge was a challenging yet enjoyable assignment. It was interesting to pull data from the web using the APIs, and the plotting maps with hv.plot is a great way to display data.

For the WeatherPy section, I started by pulling random latitude/longitude combinations using CitiPy to create a random list of 592 cities. I then captured the latitude, longitude, temperature max, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, and date for each city and created a DataFrame. With this DataFrame, I created two scatter plots (one for Northern Hemisphere cities and one for Southern Hemisphere cities) for each of temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed to compare with latitude. We computed linear regression for each of these relationships and analyzed the r value and correlation of each relationship. 

For the VacationPy section, I used the same DataFrame that I created in the WeatherPy section to create a map that displays the cities within that DataFrame. I then narrowed down my data frame to cities with my ideal weather conditions regarding tmeperature, cloudiness, and wind speed. I then created a new DataFrame with an additional "Hotel Name" column that contained nearest hotel to the coordinates of each city in my Ideal Weather DataFrame within a 10,000 meter radius. Lastly, I created a map that showed the locations of the hotel that also showed additional information when hovering over each hotel location.
